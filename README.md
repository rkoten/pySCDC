# pySCDC
S,C-dense coding in Python 3

### Usage
Put the text file (by default named `text.txt`) in the working directory, run the script. It will create a vocabulary in `vocab.txt`, as well as `encode` and `decode` directories.

Vocabulary consists of source file's MD5 hashsum and text elements (words and punctuation) sorted by descending rate of occurrence. Default supported punctuation includes the following symbols: { `.,!?:;` }. It can be modified via `PATTERN` string defined at the top of the script.

Encode folder will contain 255 variants of dense codes (for each S value in `[1, 255]`).  
Decode folder will contain 255 copies of original text if worked correctly, each decoded from corresponding encode file.

*Script is weakly tested, consider it a sample implementation.*
